# App Engine Email to SMS #

This is a simple little app I threw together to help forward Outlook reminders to my cell phone via Twilio.

It does a few things:
*  Allows users to sign up via email
*  Allows users to update their phone number via email
*  Provides users with the VBA code needed to have outlook forward formatted reminders
*  Allows uses to opt out
*  Restricts users based on their email domain (this isn't online banking!)
