Hey, thanks for sending me an email, I'd love to help you remind you about your meetings!

In order to help you, I need you to do a couple of things.

First, please reply to this message with your phone number (10 digits, please) in the subject line so that I know where to send the alerts.

Second, I need you to copy and paste some code into Outlook.
(This is the code that sends me what I send to you!)

To start, open Outlook and press Alt+F11.
You should see a new window.
Now click on ThisOutlookSession and paste the code from %s/outlook-code into the white area on the right and then close the window.

In order for this code to work every time you run Outlook, you'll need to tell Outlook to let the code (or "macro") run.
In Outlook, go to File -> Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings -> Macro Settings and choose “Notifications for all macros.”
This will notify you that you’re allowing the script to run every time you start up Outlook.
When you open Outlook, just click “Enable Macros” on the window that pops up. Easy!

Ok, that's it!

Once you respond with your phone number, I'll send you a confirmation letting you know that you should start receiving text messages about your meetings and reminders.

As long as Outlook is running, the messages should keep coming!

PS. To stop receiving alerts, just send me a message with STOP in the subject line or delete the code you added to ThisOutlookSession.
